## Floorheating Pump Controller

This code is designed to run on a custom hardware board, based on the Mbed Platform. It measures temperature on four places on a floor heating heat exchanger:
- Central heating inlet temperature
- Central heating return temperature
- Floor output temperature
- Floor return temperature 
The custom board logs these temperatures to memory. This data can be used in conjunction with OpenTherm data of the Central Heating system, output of a smart gas meter and other data sources to obtain insight in the workings and optimal control methods of the floor heating system. 

The system also has an solid state relay output for controlling the floor heating pump.
